## Appendix

Additional Information

It works in the same way that cell phones do with contacts. In this project, you can add, view, edit, search, and delete contacts. A file is preserved for all records that have been added or updated.
Name, phone number, and email address can all be used to categorize your contacts. File handling was used to record all of the information. To save the userâ€™s name, email, and contact information, I used a data structure.
